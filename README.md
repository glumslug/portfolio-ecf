<h1>Eli Ferster Portfolio Site</h1>

This portfolio site is built using Gatsby JS. The styling is done using SASS. I
developed the entire site from scratch, with no templates. I did, however, take
inspiration from various other portfolio sites on the web.

  <li>CSS-only tabs for each sub-project in the portfolio.</li>
  <li>Fully animated titles/subtitles for all pages.</li>
  <li>Nice animated drop-down menu on small screens.</li>
</ul>
